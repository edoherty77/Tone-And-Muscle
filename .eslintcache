He wanted to lose the belly fat he had accumulated but still maintain all the muscle mass.

While he had been an athlete a lot of his life, strength training never had made its way into his routine.

After adopting ideas from the TMA meal plans into his diet he learned how to prepare for the week and prioritize his work outs no matter how busy his business got. Currently at 222 lbs, Kevin is 60 lbs down from his original weight and stronger all around than hes ever been.',\n  bujacich:\n    ' Alex came into the program wanting to kick the habit of buying most of his meals from Grubhub and then establish an effective training routine at home since the gyms had closed for quarantine.

Once he was given clear cut strategies on how to eat and exercise Alex never looked back. His discipline and action helped him lose 20 lbs in 12 weeks and pack on muscle from the comfort of his own home. On top of the physical changes he created, Alexs biggest wins came from preparing his meals at home. He not saved thousands of dollars by eliminating take out from his diet, but attained new levels of energy throughout the day since he was now consuming whole foods that he prepped for
