Once he was given clear cut strategies on how to eat and exercise Alex never looked back. His discipline and action helped him lose 20 lbs in 12 weeks and pack on muscle from the comfort of his own home. On top of the physical changes he created, Alexs biggest wins came from preparing his meals at home.
