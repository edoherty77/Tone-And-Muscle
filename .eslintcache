started with the Tone & Muscle Academy when he decided that he wanted to finally see things change for good. While he was super strong at some of the major lifts like squats, deadlifts, and bench press, he still wanted more. He wanted to lose the belly fat he had accumulated but still maintain all the muscle mass. Mike followed the TMA meal plans for 6 months, and a year and half later is currently still utilizing the training program. Down 60 lbs, and eating intuitively Mike is stronger all around than hes ever been.',\n  conway:\n    'With quarantine set in and the gyms closed Jack came into the TMA without any experience lifting weights. While he had been an athlete a lot of his life, strength training never had made its way into his routine. Jack adopted TMAs home routine and began balancing his work, newborn child, and lifting regimen while adhering to the meal plans. After 12 weeks Jack learned all about how to prioritize whole foods into his diet, lost 15 lbs, and now is stronger than hes ever been...all without ever leaving the house.',\n  poplaski:\n    'Kevin a former college wrestler and current entrepreneur found the TMA at a time where he was extremely busy getting his mead business off the ground. However, eating what he could when he could wasnt serving him well as he was weighing 282 and was eating foods that werent giving him the energy to train on his downtime. After adopting ideas from the TMA meal plans into his diet he learned how to prepare for the week and prioritize his work outs no matter how busy his business got. Currently at 222 lbs, Kevin is 60 lbs down from his original weight and stronger all around than hes ever been.',\n  bujacich:\n    ' Alex came into the program wanting to kick the habit of buying most of his meals from Grubhub and then establish an effective training routine at home since the gyms had closed for quarantine. His life was busy as he was attaining new responsibilities from his promotion at work and was in the midst of buying his first property. Once he was given clear cut strategies on how to eat and exercise Alex never looked back. His discipline and action helped him lose 20 lbs in 12 weeks and pack on muscle from the comfort of his own home. On top of the physical changes he created, Alexs biggest wins came from preparing his meals at home. He not saved thousands of dollars by eliminating take out from his diet, but attained new levels of energy throughout the day since he was now consuming whole foods that he prepped for himself.',\n}\n\nconst Testimonials = () => {\n  //Hook for modal state\n  const [isMikeOpen, setMikeOpen] = useState(false)\n  const [isJackOpen, setJackOpen] = useState(false)\n  const [isKevinOpen,
