While he had been an athlete a lot of his life, strength training never had made its way into his routine.

After 12 weeks Jack learned all about how to prioritize whole foods into his diet, lost 15 lbs, and now is stronger than hes ever been...all without ever leaving the house.',\n  poplaski:\n    'Kevin a former college wrestler and current entrepreneur found the TMA at a time where he was extremely busy getting his mead business off the ground.

After adopting ideas from the TMA meal plans into his diet he learned how to prepare for the week and prioritize his work outs no matter how busy his business got.
